summary: "
<p>This course is designed for novices in Kotlin and focuses on the object-oriented (OOP) concepts of the Kotlin language.
It is the second module of this course, the first module can be found on the <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21067-kotlin-onboarding--introduction\">marketplace</a>.
This module assumes that you are familiar with all the constructs from the first part.</p>

<p>Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a web project: step by step, by completing different small tasks,
you will get a finished small project in the end. At the end of each lesson, an additional similar project
will be offered: it includes all the topics of the lesson but does not contain the theory part.</p>

<p><i>Note, this course does not provide a detailed explanation of the OOP concepts, 
it just shows how to use them in Kotlin and can briefly remind you of the definitions.</i></p>

<p>All topics will be accompanied by links to <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html\">the official Kotlin documentation</a>, 
which you can read later. Some of the topics covered in the course are listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>packages;</li>
  <li>classes, properties, and member functions;</li>
  <li>type aliases;</li>
  <li>value and data classes;</li>
